HEY, this is just a trial !
Just informing that this is just a trial did not seem so good so here I am updating about all that I did so far.
I first created a branch as I can not make changes in the master directly , then I updated the branch , staged it .committed it and sent it for a review. Now it will be merged into the master branch after these new changes are staged and committed.
